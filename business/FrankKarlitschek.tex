\chapter{What I would do different next time or Underestimating the value of an Open Source business model - Frank Karlitschek}

\section*{Introduction}

Ten years ago I underestimated the value of a business model. Free software and a business model? They don’t belong together. At least, that’s what I thought when I started contributing to KDE in 2001. Open Source is about fun and not money. Right?  Free software people want a world where everybody can write software and huge companies, like Microsoft or Google, are superfluous. Software should be free and anyone who wants to develop software, should be able to do so – even hobby developers. So earning money is not important. Right? Today, I hold a different opinion.  Sometimes developers should be remunerated for their efforts.  

\section*{The free software motivation}

Most free software developers have two basic motivations to work on free software. The first motivation is the fun factor. It's a fantastic experience to work together with very talented people from all over the world and create great technology. KDE, for example, is one of the most welcoming communities I know. It's so much fun to work with thousands of contributors from all over the world to create software which will be used by millions. Basically, everyone is an expert in one or more areas and we collaborate to create a shared vision. For me it's always a blast to meet other KDE contributors, exchange ideas or work on our software. Whether we meet online, or in real life at one of the many conferences or events. And it's also about friendship. Over the years I’ve made many good friends in KDE.

But, KDE contributors are not only motivated by fun to join KDE. It's also the idea that we all can make the world a better place with out contributions. Free software is essential, if you care about access to technology and IT for developing countries. It enables poor people to participate in the information age even without buying expensive licenses for proprietary software. It's essential for people who care about privacy and security, because free software is the only way to see what exactly your computer is doing with your private data. Free software is important for a healthy IT eco-system, because it enables everybody to build on the work of others and really innovate. Without free software it wouldn't have been possible for Google or Facebook to start their businesses. It's not possible to innovate and create the next disruptive technology if you depend on proprietary software and don't have full access to all parts of the software.

Free software is also essential for education, because everybody can see all the internals of software and study how it works. That’s how free software helps to make the world a better place and why I contribute to free software projects such as KDE. 


\section*{The need for an eco-system}

These are the main reasons why I want to see free software, and especially the free desktop, become mainstream. To make this happen, we need a lot more contributors than we have today. With contributors I mean people who write the core frameworks, the desktop, great applications. We need people who work on usability, artwork, promotion and many other important areas. KDE is already a really big community with thousands of members. But, to compete with proprietary software in a big way, we need more people to help. The free software community is tiny compared to the proprietary software world. On the one hand this is not a problem, because the distributed software development model of the free software world is much more efficient than  the closed source way of writing software. One big advantage is, for example, the ability to re-use code better. But even with these advantages we need many more contributors than we have today, if we really want to conquer the desktop and mobile markets.

We also need companies to help us bring our work to the mass market. In a nutshell, we need a big and healthy eco-system that enables people to work on free software as their jobs.


\section*{The current situation}

I started contributing to KDE over 10 years ago and since then I’ve seen countless highly motivated and talented people join KDE. This is really cool. The problem is that I also saw a lot of experienced contributors dropping out of KDE. That’s really sad. Sometimes it’s just the normal way of the world. Priorities shift and people concentrate on other stuff. The problem is that many also drop out because of money. At some point people graduate and want to move out of their dorm rooms. Later some people want to get married and have kids. At this point people have to find jobs. There are some companies in the KDE ecosystem that offer KDE-related jobs. But these are only a fraction of the available IT jobs. So, a lot of senior KDE contributors have to work for companies where they  work on proprietary software, unrelated to KDE and free software. Sooner or later most of these developers drop out of KDE.
I underestimated this factor 10 years ago, but I think it is a problem for KDE in the long term, because we lose our most experienced people to proprietary software companies.

\section*{My dream world}

In my dream world people can pay their rent by working on free software. And they can do it in a way, which is in sync with our free software values. KDE contributors have all the time they need to contribute to KDE and free software in general. They earn money by doing KDE. Their hobbies become their jobs. This would make KDE grow in a big way, because it's fun to contribute and a good long-term job opportunity on top.  

\section*{What are the options?}

So what are the options? What can we do to make this happen? Are there ways for developers to pay their rent, while working on free software? I want to list a few ideas here that I collected during several discussions with free software contributors. Some of them are probably controversial, because they introduce completely new ideas into the free software world. But I think it is essential for us to think beyond our current world if we want to be successful with our mission.  

\paragraph*{Sponsored development}

Today, more and more companies appreciate the importance of free software  and contribute to free software projects, or even release their own completely free software projects. This is an opportunity for free software developers. We should talk to more companies and convince them to work with the free software world. 

\paragraph*{End-user donations}

There should be an easy way for end-users to donate money directly to developers. If a user of a popular application wants to support the developer and promote the further development  of the application, donating money should be just one mouse click away. The donation system can be built into the application to make it as easy as possible to send money.

\paragraph*{Bounties}

The idea behind bounties is that one or more users of an application can pay for the development of a specific feature. A user can list his feature request on a website and say how much he is willing to pay for the feature. Other users who also like the same feature may add some money to the feature request. At some point the developer starts to develop the feature and collects the money from the users. This bounty feature is not easy to implement. People tried already to set a system like this up and failed. But I think it can work if we do it right. 

\paragraph*{Support}

The idea is that the developer of an application sells direct support to the user base of the application. For example, the users of an application buy support for, let's say, \$5 a month and get the right to call the developer directly at a specific time of the day. Or, users may post questions to a specific email address, or the developer can even help the users via a remote desktop. I realize many developers won’t like the idea that users call them and ask strange questions, but if this means that they earn enough with the support system to work full-time on their applications, then it must be a good thing.

\paragraph*{Supporters}

This is the idea that end-users can become supporters of an application. The "Become a Supporter" button is directly build into the application. The user becomes a subscriber for a monthly payment of, for example \$5, which goes directly to the developer. All the supporters are listed in the "About Dialog" of the application together with their photos and real names. Once a year all supporters are also invited to a special supporter party together with the developers. It's possible that a developer may be able to work full-time on an application, if enough users become supporters.

\paragraph*{Affiliate programs}

Some applications are integrated in web services and some of these web services run affiliate programs. For example, a Media Player can be integrated in the Amazon mp3 MusicStore, or a PDF Reader can be integrated in an eBook Store. Every time a user buys content via the application, the developer gets some money.

\paragraph*{App store for application binaries}

Many people don't know that it is possible to sell binaries of free software. The GPL only requires you to also provide the source code. So, it's perfectly legal and OK to sell nicely packaged binaries of our software. In fact, companies such as Redhat or Novell already sell our software in their commercial distributions. But the developers do not benefit from it directly. All the revenue goes to the Linux companies and nothing to the developers. So we could enable the free software developers to sell nicely packaged, optimized and tested applications to the end-user. This might work especially well on Mac or Windows. I'm sure a lot of users would pay \$3 for an Amarok Windows Binary, or Digikam for Mac, if all the money goes directly to the developer.

\section*{Conclusion}

I hope  these ideas inspire discussion about this important topic. It would be perfect if we could push one or more of these ideas forward, so that more free software developers can find a way to pay their rent while developing free KDE software.
I would love to hear your feedback on these ideas. So, please stop me if you see me at a conference, or other free software event, to exchange ideas. Or simply send me a message. I look forward to more feedback from the community.

\chapter{Being Allowed To Do Awesome - Lydia Pintscher}

Free Software has an enemy. It is not who most people on the internet think it is. No, it is a lack of active participation.

Every single day there are thousands of people out there looking for a way to put meaning into their life, looking for ways to do something that truly matters. Every single day thousands of lines of code for Free Software projects are waiting to be written and debugged, programs are waiting to be promoted and translated, artwork is waiting to be created and much more. Sadly, way too often these two do not meet. There are several reasons for that. It starts with people not knowing about Free Software at all and its benefits and purpose. But we are getting there. People start to use and maybe even understand Free Software on a large scale. Free Software projects live from converting some of those users into active contributors. This is where the problems begin.

I have managed hundreds of students in mentoring programs and been doing outreach in various forms for Free Software projects. I've worked with enthusiastic people whose life was changed for the better by their contributions to Free Software. But one theme I see over and over again and it breaks my heart because I now know what talent we are missing out on: not being allowed to do awesome. It is best summarized by what a fellow Google Summer of Code mentor said: ``The insight that most people in open source didn’t get allowed to work on stuff but just didn’t run fast enough at the right moment seems to be rare.'' Potential contributors think they are not allowed to contribute. The reasons for this are many and they are all misconceptions. The most common misconceptions in my experience are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item ``I can not write code. There can not possibly be a way for me to contribute.''
 \item ``I am not really good at this. My help is not needed.''
 \item ``I would just be a burden. They have more important things to worry about.''
 \item ``I am not needed. They must already have enough much more brilliant people than me.''
\end{itemize}
Those are almost always false and I wish I had known a long time ago that they are so prevalent. I would have done a lot of my initial outreach efforts differently.

The easiest way of getting someone out of this situation is to invite them personally. ``That workshop we are doing? Oh yes, you should come. That bug in the bug tracker? I'm sure you're the perfect person to try to fix it. That press release we need to get done? It would be great if you could read over it and make sure it is good.'' And if that is not possible, make sure that your outreach material (you have some, right?) clearly states what kind of people you are looking for and what you consider the basic requirements. Make sure to especially reach out to people outside your usual contributor base because for them this barrier is even bigger. And unless you overcome that you recruit who you are unless you actively do something about it -- meaning you will get more contributors just like the ones you already have unless you make an effort to reach out to other people.
